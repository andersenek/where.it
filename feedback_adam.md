## Project Workflow

How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: I really liked your wireframes, and your initial user stories were
great! A few suggestions for improvement:
* make sure your user stories are up to date to match your development... there
are a lot of features (editing / deleteing comments) that don't have an
equivalent user story. Another way to think about this is that your user stories
are a living document, not a PDF that is finished early on! In fact, I'd suggest
not using a PDF for your user stories, but either a markdown/text file or Trello
(or similar tool).
* Your readme should be fleshed out a bit more.. (see the project promp for
suggests on what your readme should include.)

## Technical Requirements

How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: Great job! This was at the high end of 'meets expectations' for
me. I really liked your use of has_many through, and that you implemented
search. It's clear you have a solid grasp on the fundamentals of Rails and MVC
frameworks!

## Creativity/Interface

How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?

**Exceeds expectations**

**Comments**: Great job here! Your design is awesome, and the UX is very nice.
The sample data makes your app feel very 'put together'. No real suggestions
for improvement here!

## Code Quality

Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: Overall, your code is very clearly written and clean, especially
your views, which I thought was awesome (since those are often the hardest to
keep readable.). Excellent job! See my inline comments for a few suggestions.

## Deployment and Functionality

How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?

**Meets expectations**

**Comments**: Your app has a great amount of functionality for a P2 MVP, which
is awesome. I didn't encounter any errors / unfinished features. If there were
just a bit more functionality (e.g. maybe adding tags or categories, etc) I
would have easily marked this as exceeds expectations. Great job!
